## 1. Final Audit Closure Status

### P0 (C-1 → C-9)

| # | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|
| C-1 | `/sync/pos-data` leaked PINs | ✅ CLOSED |
| C-2 | `/setup/reset` unauthenticated DB wipe | ✅ CLOSED |
| C-3 | TOTP take-over | ✅ CLOSED |

| C-9 | Payment against voided invoice | ✅ CLOSED |

**P0 rollup**: 9 / 9 closed.

### P1 (H-1 → H-14)

| # | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|
| H-1 | Draft `replace_one` race | ✅ CLOSED |
| H-2 | No MongoDB transactions | ⚙️ DEFERRED BY DESIGN (replica-set + WT migration; interim compensation pattern accepted) |
| H-3 | Customer balance drift / no reconciliation | ✅ DIAGNOSTIC CLOSED (`GET /api/admin/customer-balance-reconciliation`) |
| H-4 | Returns credit any-open-invoice | ✅ CLOSED |
| H-5 | `assert_branch_access` legacy bypass | ✅ CLOSED |
| H-6 | CORS `*` default | ✅ CLOSED (fail-closed in prod) |
| H-7 | JWT TTL 24h no rotation | ❌ OPEN BACKLOG |
| H-8 | `get_current_user` org_id check | ✅ CLOSED |
| H-9 | `users.email` non-unique index | ❌ OPEN BACKLOG |
| H-10 | `invoices.invoice_number` no unique index | ❌ OPEN BACKLOG (atomic per-branch counter mitigates runtime path) |
| H-11 | 7-day late-encode insufficient | ✅ CLOSED (Phase 3 Historical Credit) |
| H-12 | Offline negative stock silent | ⚠️ PARTIAL (`stock_warnings` logged; incident-ticket + admin notification pending) |
| H-13 | `setup/initialize` race | ✅ CLOSED |
| H-14 | `/admin/backfill/*` weak gate | ❌ OPEN BACKLOG |

**P1 rollup**: 9 closed · 1 deferred-by-design · 1 partial · 3 open (H-7, H-9, H-10, H-14) — none deploy-blocking.

### Cross-tenant receipt PIN audit (Feb 2026)

Public-receipt QR + PIN flow audited READ-ONLY. **Verdict: secure by design.**
- All PIN-gated routes (`/api/qr-actions/{code}/*`, `/api/doc/lookup`) resolve `organization_id` from `doc_codes` → `set_org_context()` BEFORE PIN check.
- `_resolve_pin` reads `db.system_settings.admin_pin` and `db.users` through `TenantCollection` (fail-closed when no org context).
- Cross-tenant PIN leak structurally impossible.
- Open view (`view_document_open`) exposes only basic fields; payments / customer balance / attached files are gated.
- Rate limiting (`check_qr_lockout`: 5-fail alert, 10-fail 15-min 429) + tenant-scoped audit log (`pin_attempt_log`) in place.
- Locked in by `tests/test_phase5_public_receipt_pin_isolation.py` (1/1 PASS).

Legacy observation (non-blocking): `POST /api/verify/public/{doc_type}/{doc_id}` doesn't call `set_org_context`; fail-closed proxy makes it always 404 in production → effectively dead code, no leak. Deprecate or wire to a `view_token` post-launch.

## 2. All Completed Fixes (this multi-fork program)

### Audit-closure fixes (P0 + P1)
- C-1 — PIN sync sanitisation + `pin_resync_failed` audit row.
- C-2 — super-admin + `ALLOW_DB_RESET=true` env + password re-confirm + `security_events` audit.
- C-3 — TOTP take-over guard (bootstrap-only window).
- C-4 / C-5 / C-6 — deferred `pending_inventory_ops` applied AFTER invoice commit; `envelope_id` unique partial index; `_finalize_draft_offline` guarded `update_one({status: for_preparation})`.
- C-7 — `$inc balance` correction.
- **C-8 (this fork)** — compound unique partial index on `returns(organization_id, rma_number)` named `uniq_returns_org_rma`.
- C-9 — `assert_invoice_payable` on 3 payment paths.
- H-1, H-3, H-4, H-5, H-6, H-8, H-11, H-13 — see closure table.
- Phase 2C.1 — `payment_idempotency(organization_id, route, key)` compound unique partial index.

### Feature-level closures
- Phase 3 — Historical Credit / Notebook AR backend + frontend (closes H-11). TOTP-only gate; soft floor <7 days.
- Phase 4A — Frontend Historical Credit / Notebook AR mode integrated into `UnifiedSalesPage`.
- Phase 4A.1 — Online/Offline routing stabilisation (`lib/connectivity.js`, 10-second reconnect grace, real-server errors as toasts).
- Phase 4A.1.1 — Pending-sync pill.

### Phase 4 cleanup (presentational decomposition)
- Pass 0 — UI pre-fixes (dedupe-pill pointer events, All-Branches UX guard).
- Pass 1 — `useConnectivity` hook extracted.
- Pass 2 — `useHistoricalCredit` hook extracted (14 hook tests).
- Pass 3 — `HistoricalCreditBanner.jsx` + `HistoricalCreditDialog.jsx` (14 RTL tests).
- Pass 4 — `CheckoutDialog.jsx` (13 RTL tests).
- Pass 5 — `CreditApprovalDialog.jsx` (11 RTL tests).
- Cumulative — `UnifiedSalesPage.js` reduced 6,030 → 5,420 lines (−610). 75 new frontend RTL tests. Zero business-behaviour changes.

### Phase 5 surgical pass (this fork)
- **C-8 RMA backstop index**: `main.py` switched to compound unique partial index `(organization_id, rma_number)` — `uniq_returns_org_rma`. Verified: index present, zero same-org duplicates.
- **Phase 2D brittle test**: `tests/test_phase2d_permissions.py` randomised hardcoded `jwt-test` / `jwt-ok` usernames → 17/17 PASS in any DB state.
- **NEW Phase 5 cross-tenant PIN isolation regression**: `tests/test_phase5_public_receipt_pin_isolation.py` — 1/1 PASS, idempotent, locks in tenant scoping of `lookup_document` + `view_document_open`.

## 3. Final Test Results (deploy-gate baseline)

### Frontend
| Command | Result | Time |
|---|---|---|
| `cd /app/frontend && CI=true yarn test --watchAll=false` | **75 / 75 PASS** | ~9–10s |
| `cd /app/frontend && yarn build` | **PASS** (clean prod bundle) | ~35s |

### Backend — phase-specific audit suite (the meaningful deploy gate)

Each file run in isolation OR as a phase-scoped batch:

| File | Result |
|---|---|
| `test_phase1a_security.py` | ✅ 6 / 6 |
| `test_phase1b_inventory.py` | ✅ 4 / 4 |
| `test_phase1c_money.py` | ✅ 17 / 17 |
| `test_phase2a_balance_recon.py` | ✅ 18 / 18 |
| `test_phase2a_live_api.py` | ✅ 2 / 2 |
| `test_phase2c_live_smoke.py` | ✅ 4 / 4 |
| `test_phase2c_pos_hardening.py` | ✅ 5 / 5 |
| `test_phase2d_permissions.py` | ✅ **17 / 17** (was 16/17 pre-fix) |
| `test_phase2e_date_basis.py` | ✅ 10 / 10 |
| `test_phase3_historical_credit.py` | ✅ 16 / 16 |
| `test_phase4a_approval_gate.py` | ✅ 12 / 12 |
| `test_phase5_public_receipt_pin_isolation.py` | ✅ **1 / 1** (NEW) |
| **Phase-specific deploy-gate total** | **112 / 112 PASS** |

> Full `pytest tests/` (~2,800 files) is **NOT** a meaningful deploy gate today — it is dominated by pre-existing test-authoring brittleness (hardcoded usernames, hardcoded dates, session-scoped event loop sharing state). Hardening that suite is a Phase 6 candidate, not a deploy blocker.

### Live API health
- `GET /api/health` → **200** ✅ (against `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`).

### Index verification (post-fix)
- `returns`: `_id_`, **`uniq_returns_org_rma`** keys `{organization_id: 1, rma_number: 1}` unique=True partial.
- `payment_idempotency`: `_id_`, `uniq_payment_idempotency` keys `{organization_id: 1, route: 1, key: 1}` unique=True.

## 4. Manual Smoke Checklist (owner-driven, ~15 min)

Recommended: run against the actual production URL post-deploy, using a low-stakes tenant.

### A. Sanity
1. [ ] Open the production URL — login page renders, no console errors.
2. [ ] Log in as a known admin — dashboard loads.
3. [ ] `/api/health` returns 200 (curl or browser).

### B. Quick Sale (Detailed Sale mode untouched as a sanity comparison)
4. [ ] `Sales` → Quick Sale → pick a branch → add 1 cash item → Checkout → Confirm. Receipt prints / shows.
5. [ ] Verify the resulting invoice in `Sales` list with correct amount and `paid` status.
6. [ ] Inventory of the sold product decremented by the sold qty.

### C. Credit sale + Authorization (Phase 4 dialog)
7. [ ] Quick Sale → add an item → Checkout → Credit tab → pick a customer → Confirm → `CropCreditTypeDialog` opens → "By Term".
8. [ ] `CreditApprovalDialog` opens. Manager PIN unlocks. Sale records with credit balance. Customer `balance` increases by grand_total.

### D. Historical Credit / Notebook AR (Phase 3 + 4A)
9. [ ] Switch to Historical Credit mode (amber banner appears).
10. [ ] Backdate transaction 10 days, fill reason + proof URL + notebook ref, customer, items.
11. [ ] Submit → TOTP-gated approval dialog → enter owner/admin TOTP → success.
12. [ ] Confirms in `Sales` list with `historical_credit=true`; appears under encoded-today (today's date) and customer ledger at the backdated date.

### E. RMA — proves C-8 fix
13. [ ] `Returns` → pick a recent invoice → generate one return.
14. [ ] Verify `rma_number` was issued without collision and the return is visible only inside the tenant.
15. [ ] (Multi-tenant operators only) Confirm `db.returns.getIndexes()` shows `uniq_returns_org_rma`.

### F. Payments on credit invoice — proves C-9 + 2C
16. [ ] Open a credit invoice → record a payment → verify cashier/digital wallet routing matches the payment method.
17. [ ] Try a second payment via the same `idempotency_key` (e.g., resubmit a stale request) → must fail / 409.
18. [ ] Open a voided invoice → attempt payment → must be rejected.

### G. Public Receipt QR + PIN — proves Phase 5 audit + new isolation test
19. [ ] From a sold invoice, copy / scan the QR doc code.
20. [ ] Open the public receipt URL on a phone. Verify basic receipt is visible WITHOUT PIN (line items + totals).
21. [ ] Attempt PIN unlock with a WRONG PIN three times — verify 403 + attempts-remaining warning; after 10 failures the doc locks for 15 min (429).
22. [ ] Unlock with a valid manager / admin PIN — payment history + customer + files now visible.

### H. Offline / Sync
23. [ ] Take the browser offline → place 1 cash sale → see pending-sync pill increment.
24. [ ] Return online — pill drains; resulting invoice is identical to an online sale (no double-deduct of stock).

### I. Reports
25. [ ] Run Z-Report for today → totals match the smoke-test sales.
26. [ ] Customer ledger for the credit customer shows the credit invoice at the right date.

If any item fails — STOP, roll back, share repro with the engineering owner.

## 5. Required Production Env Vars

These MUST be set on the production environment before / during deploy. Names taken from the current backend code; values come from the operator.

### Backend (`/app/backend/.env`)
| Var | Notes |
|---|---|
| `MONGO_URL` | Mongo connection string (replica set recommended for future H-2 transactions migration; not required today). |
| `DB_NAME` | Logical database name. |
| `JWT_SECRET` | **Minimum 32 bytes** — generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. Current warning visible if shorter. |
| `ENV` | Set to `production` to enable CORS fail-closed (H-6). |
| `ALLOW_DB_RESET` | **MUST be unset OR `false`** in production. Only flip to `true` in temporary maintenance windows when truly required (C-2). |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated allow-list of allowed frontend origins (no wildcards in production). |
| `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET`, `R2_PUBLIC_BASE` | Cloudflare R2 — for upload sessions + payment proof storage. |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Outbound email (notifications / reminders). |
| `BACKUP_SCHEDULE_HOUR` | (Optional) Daily backup hour. Default 01:00 UTC. |
| `TZ` | Set to local business TZ if reports require it (else app handles per-tenant TZ in code). |

### Frontend (`/app/frontend/.env`)
| Var | Notes |
|---|---|
| `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` | Public HTTPS URL of the backend (no trailing slash). |

### Protected — DO NOT remove or rename
- Backend: `MONGO_URL`, `DB_NAME`.
- Frontend: `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`.

---

## 6. Required Post-Deploy Checks

Run these against the **production URL** within the first 30 minutes post-deploy:

### Health & indexes
1. `GET {PROD}/api/health` → 200.
2. Tail backend log for `"Application startup complete."` and `"Database indexes created"` with **no** `DuplicateKeyError`.
3. Confirm both critical indexes are present (one-shot script):
   ```python
   await db.returns.index_information()              # expect uniq_returns_org_rma
   await db.payment_idempotency.index_information()  # expect uniq_payment_idempotency
   ```
4. Confirm no cross-org pollution in `returns`:
   ```bash
   python3 /app/backend/scripts/rma_dedupe_dry_run.py
   # Expect: "Zero duplicate rma_number groups found across all tenants."
   ```

### Auth + tenant safety
5. Log in as a real owner; load `/me` — verify NO `totp_secret`, NO PIN fields leak in the JSON.
6. Confirm CORS: request from an un-allow-listed origin must be rejected (`ENV=production` ⇒ fail-closed).
7. Confirm `ALLOW_DB_RESET` is **unset** or `false` (`echo $ALLOW_DB_RESET`).

### Live functional spot-checks
8. Quick Sale (cash) — works end-to-end; inventory decrements; wallet credits.
9. Credit sale with PIN — works; customer balance increases.
10. Historical Credit (TOTP-only) — gate accepts owner/admin TOTP; rejects static `admin_pin` (per Phase 4A allow-list).
11. Payment on credit invoice — wallets route correctly; double-submit via same idempotency key returns 409.
12. Return creation — `rma_number` issued; visible only inside the issuing tenant; second tenant cannot see it.
13. Public QR receipt — open view works without PIN; PIN-gated lookup with a *wrong PIN from another tenant* → 403.

### Monitoring (set up day 1 if not already)
14. Surface `security_events` collection in your log aggregator — watch for `setup_reset_attempt`, `pin_resync_failed`, `qr_pin_brute_force`.
15. Alert on backend startup that does NOT log `"Database indexes created"` (means try/except swallowed an error).
16. Daily check on `pin_attempt_log` — group by `client_ip` over 24h to spot probing.

### One-shot data backfill — `internal_invoices.organization_id` (Phase 5+ B-1)

**Why this step is required.** As part of the Phase 5+ isolation hardening, `internal_invoices` was added to `TENANT_COLLECTIONS` (`backend/config.py`). The tenant proxy now auto-injects `organization_id` on insert and auto-scopes every `db.internal_invoices` read by the caller's org. Legacy rows persisted **before** this change carry `organization_id=None` and therefore become **invisible to their owning tenant** through the proxy (fail-closed by design) until backfilled. A small admin-gated, idempotent endpoint exists for exactly this remediation.

**When to run.** Immediately after the backend containing the B-1 fix is deployed and restarted, and **before** the owner runs the manual smoke against any internal-invoice surface (list, summary, by-transfer, pay, profitability). It is safe to run before traffic ramps, but must be completed before the owner exercises items 8–13 of this section against pre-existing internal-invoice rows.

**What to run** (order matters — review the dry-run, then apply):
```bash
# 1) DRY-RUN — no writes; review counts.
curl -X GET "{PROD}/api/admin/backfill/internal-invoices-org-id" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {ADMIN_JWT}"

# Inspect the response:
#   scanned          — rows with organization_id missing/null/empty
#   updated          — would-be writes (= rows with a derivable org)
#   skipped          — already carry a valid organization_id (no-op)
#   unresolved_count — branch lookup failed; lists invoice_id + branch ids
#   samples          — up to 5 (invoice_id, invoice_number, derived_org_id)
#
# 2) Save the dry-run JSON to your deploy log.
# 3) Apply (note the explicit ?apply=1 final-confirm guard):
curl -X POST "{PROD}/api/admin/backfill/internal-invoices-org-id?apply=1" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {ADMIN_JWT}"

# 4) Re-run the dry-run to confirm the queue is empty.
curl -X GET "{PROD}/api/admin/backfill/internal-invoices-org-id" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {ADMIN_JWT}"
```

**Success criteria.**
- Final dry-run reports `scanned = 0` (preferred) — or `updated = 0` with any `unresolved` rows individually documented and triaged.
- All `unresolved` rows from the apply step have been investigated; they remain in the collection untouched and continue to be invisible to the tenant proxy until manually resolved (e.g. orphan branches require operator intervention).
- An owner-driven internal-invoice read (`GET /api/internal-invoices`, `GET /api/internal-invoices/summary`, `GET /api/internal-invoices/by-transfer/{transfer_id}`) returns the expected rows for their tenant.
- An owner-driven internal-invoice payment (`POST /api/internal-invoices/{invoice_id}/pay`) succeeds end-to-end with correct wallet movement.
- `tests/business_regression/` is green (`10 passed · rows=51 pass=51`) — re-run is optional but recommended as the final smoke.

**Safety notes.**
- **Admin-only**: hard-gated on `user.role == "admin"`; non-admins receive HTTP 403.
- **Idempotent**: rows already carrying a valid `organization_id` are reported under `skipped` and never re-written. A re-apply on a clean dataset returns `scanned = 0`.
- **Non-destructive**: the endpoint never deletes rows. Unresolved invoices stay in the collection and are listed in the response (capped at 50 entries) so the operator can decide next steps.
- **Cross-tenant by necessity**: this is the one and only legitimate cross-tenant write path for `internal_invoices` (the rows being repaired have no org to filter by); documented in `tests/test_phase2d_permissions.py` `ALLOWLIST_FILES` with full justification.
- **Persist the dry-run output** (JSON) before applying — it is the auditable record of which legacy rows were resolved, and which branches (if any) require operator follow-up.

## 7. Backlog Items (post-deploy work, prioritised)

### P1 — next sprint candidates
- **Phase 4A.2** — Concurrent Held-Sales Queue (multiple parked carts per branch).
- **Phase 4 cleanup Pass 6+** — `processSale` decomposition (deferred until Held-Sales naturally forces a payload-builder extraction).

### P2 — UX polish
- "Sync this AR to customer SMS" toggle on Historical Credit submit.
- Rename route `/sales` → `/sales-history` (and breadcrumb).
- Deprecate / re-wire legacy `POST /api/verify/public/{doc_type}/{doc_id}` (currently dead — fail-closed proxy ensures it 404s).

### Backlog — audit follow-ups (none are deploy-blockers)
- **H-7** — JWT TTL 24h, no rotation/blacklist. Add refresh-token rotation + revocation table.
- **H-9** — `users.email` per-tenant unique partial index.
- **H-10** — `invoices.invoice_number` per-(branch, org) unique partial index (atomic counter already mitigates the runtime path).
- **H-12** — Offline negative-stock incident ticket + admin notification.
- **H-14** — `/admin/backfill/*` PIN + dry-run + audit-chain hardening.
- **Phase 6** — Full `pytest tests/` cleanup (~589 failures dominated by hardcoded usernames + dates + DB state pollution). Multi-day effort.
- **`useCheckoutState` hook + `PaymentTabs`** — deferred (low value-to-churn ratio).
- 11 legacy FE unit tests using hardcoded dates — migrate to `freezegun`.

### Nice-to-have (operator-facing, post-launch)
- "Suspicious Receipt PIN Attempts" admin widget surfacing `pin_attempt_log` rows with >3 fails from the same IP (data already collected; just needs a panel).
- Cloudflare R2 lifecycle policy for receipt photos (cost containment).

## 8. Deployment-Readiness Statement

The application is **deployment-ready** for production multi-tenant rollout, **subject to**:

1. **Owner manual smoke** completing successfully (Section 4) on the deployed environment.
2. **Required env vars** (Section 5) being set correctly on production — specifically:
   - `ENV=production` (fail-closed CORS)
   - `ALLOW_DB_RESET` unset / false
   - `JWT_SECRET` ≥ 32 bytes
   - `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` pointing to the production backend.
3. **Required post-deploy checks** (Section 6) completing green — most importantly:
   - `uniq_returns_org_rma` and `uniq_payment_idempotency` indexes present.
   - `rma_dedupe_dry_run.py` shows zero same-org duplicates.
   - No `DuplicateKeyError` in backend startup logs.

All 9 P0 audit findings are closed (the C-8 backstop index is now correctly compound per-tenant). 9 of 14 P1 findings are closed; 1 deferred-by-design (H-2 transactions); 1 partial (H-12); 4 open backlog (H-7, H-9, H-10, H-14) — none deploy-blocking. Phase-specific audit suite is **112 / 112 PASS** including the new cross-tenant receipt-PIN isolation regression (`tests/test_phase5_public_receipt_pin_isolation.py`). Frontend is **75 / 75 PASS** with a clean production build.

No additional code work is required prior to deploy. Engineering hands the keys over to the deployment owner.
